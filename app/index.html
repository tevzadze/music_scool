				<div class="roll-block">
					<p>
						I'm a musician, producer and sound designer. I've been in the music industry for
						about 10 years now and have worked with different artists and bands, performed with
						live acts and produced a lot of music in a variety of genres.
					</p>
					<p class="desc-1">
						I have always been inspired by music and started playing musical instruments since I
						was 11 and then added up computer technologies such as DAW (digital audio
						workstation) to my skill set, which allowed me to create amazing stuff and
						manipulate sounds. After years of experimenting with different DAW's I have finally
						discovered Ableton Live which became my one-stop-shop production and performance
						tool for all my musical ideas.</p>
					<p class="desc-1">
						In this course I will guide you through all the essentials topics of music
						production, teach you how to use Ableton Live and share the necessary music
						knowledge, so you can start turning your ideas into music today.
